.. class:: Switch(state, pin)


   A class to wrap a GPIO input event as triggered by a simple switch.

   Sets up a GPIO PUD_UP Rising switch and adds a GPIO event handler to it. When the event handler is triggered by a switch event (bouncetime 100ms), it calls :method:`self.press`. Press waits for input to drop, then sends a dictionary to the state containing information about the pin location and the length of the press.

   :param state: The containing state object.
   :type state: class State
   :param pin: The GPIO pin in BCM numbering which is sending current to the switch.
   :type pin: int

   .. method:: activate(self)

      Called on initialization. Sets mode to GPIO.BCM and calls related GPIO functions to set up the switch. Adds an event detect with GPIO for GPIO.RISING events with a bouncetime of 100.


   .. method:: deactivate(self)

      Calls GPIO.remove_event_detect on this pin to deactivate it.


   .. method:: press(self, ev)

      Callback given to GPIO event detector. Gets the length of time the switch is active for, then creates an event dictionary with the following properties:

      - 'type': 'button-press'
      - 'pin': an integer corresponding to the BCM pin number the switch is wired to; `self.pin`
      - 'length': A float representing the time in seconds which the switch was active

      :param ev: The GPIO pin (BCM) on which a GPIO.RISING edge was detected
      :type ev: int



.. class:: Led(pin)


   A class for controlling LEDS by changing corresponding GPIO outputs.

   Sets mode to output on initialization

   :param pin: A BCM-numbered GPIO pin wired to from the negative lead of the LED to ground.
   :type pin: int

   .. method:: on(self)

      Turns on LED by setting GPIO.LOW on `self.pin`


   .. method:: off(self)

      Turns off LED by setting GPIO.HIGH on `self.pin`
