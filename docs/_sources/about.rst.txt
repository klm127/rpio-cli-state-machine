This project was created by Karl Miller for Professor Egelstein's System Fundamental's class in February of 2021.

This library will expand as needed to accomplish class labs. Its purpose is to hold functionality for use with Systems Fundamentals labs in order to make interesting projects. After the class is complete, it may be refactored into different libraries to keep appropriately related functionality.
